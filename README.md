## Our project:

We are going to look at Niger and Nigeria since both of them are in West Africa. They have a similar culture and religious background, so that we can keep most things in constant to compare the real influenced factors to their food demand, such as income and population structure.

## Our Goal:

1.Collect the data from Niger and Nigeria

2.Create the Estimation Demand System

3.check their Nutritional content

4.Compare their results in our presentation
